\section{Introduction}

Signals can be represented in a myraid of ways. Continuous signals, such as audible sound waves, can be intrepreted by analog circuitry or biological processes. One can also be represented by the composition of the various frequencies in the signal by its Fourier Transform. However, continuous signals are impossible to be natively analyzed by computers, which are essentially a glorified collection of on/off switches. Such signals can be \textit{sampled} to produce a signal the computer can comprehend.

This report contains details of processing a digital audio signal. The audio signal under analysis contains spoken words, as well as two undesired tones and two specific frequencies. A double notch filter is designed and implemented to remove the two undesired tones, while leaving the rest of the signal as intact as possible.
